## Description

I was motivated to create a mySQL employee tracker because it is an efficient way to organize and manage a company's employees, roles, and departments. When using this app, you'll find responsive prompts that allow you to add, view, and update employees, roles, and departments.

## Installation

Once the repository is downloaded, please navigate to the correct file path in your command terminal and enter 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies. Then login to your mySQL server and run the schema.sql file to create the database. Finally, run the seeds.sql file to populate the database with sample data.

## Usage and Testing

Once necessary dependencies are installed, run 'node app.js' in your command terminal to begin the application. Follow the prompts to add, view, and update employees, roles, and departments.

Future updates will include more customizable data and a creative splash page for the app.
